    <h3>Chicken Ramen Bowl</h3>
    <p>
      Ramen bowls are all the rage, and I've been dying to try this at home,
      especially now that the holiday hoopla is over and I'm setting my sights
      on eating whole. I never skimp on flavor, even when I'm eating light. This
      dish is a total flavor bomb, filled with a rich broth, tender meat, and
      noodles, all topped with a seven-minute egg — my new favorite thing in the
      world. My family went nuts for this; it's complex, easy, and satisfying.
      You don't have to make the egg, but I think it's so worth it.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided</li>
      <li>1 medium onion, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger</li>
      <li>½ cup rice vinegar, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add onion
        and sauté until starting to soften, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and
        ginger; cook about 30 seconds more. Add rice vinegar, soy sauce, oyster
        sauce, mirin, fish sauce, and Sriracha sauce; stir to combine. Add
        chicken broth and water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer
        for about 5 minutes. Stir in bok choy and chicken; simmer gently until
        bok choy is just tender, about 2 minutes. Cover and keep warm.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil.
        Add ramen noodles and return to a boil. Cook, uncovered and stirring
        occasionally, until noodles are tender yet firm to the bite, 5 to 7
        minutes. Drain noodles and drizzle with remaining 1 tablespoon oil to
        prevent sticking.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the ramen is cooking, fill a pot with enough water to cover the
        eggs and bring to a boil. Gently lower eggs into the boiling water and
        cook until yolks are barely set, about 7 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fill a large bowl with ice water. Transfer eggs to the ice bath to stop
        the cooking process; let sit about 3 minutes. Drain eggs, carefully peel
        away the shells, and slice in half.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide ramen between four bowls. Add broth, then top with jalapeño,
        green onions, cilantro, and soft boiled egg halves. Serve immediately.
      </li>
    </ol>
